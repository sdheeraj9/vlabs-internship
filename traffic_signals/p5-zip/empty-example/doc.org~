#+title: Iterative System Example : Traffic signal manager


* Introduction
This application built using javascript and p5 framework uses iterative loops
to make a traffic signal manager for a Y-junction ie; an intersection of three
roads. Each of these roads are single lane roads thereby making it unfeasible
to give a free left to the roads. This increases the need for an optimized code
giving access to all roads with minimum waiting period at the signal.
* Implementation

** Initial Setup
The setup function creates a canvas of the entire page size.
info_1, info_2, info_3, road_1, road_2, road_3 display font on the web page. In
addition to this, the roads and the signals have been created using line and
ellipse commands. And a button named Start has been created.

function setup() {

  // create canvas
  createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);

info_1 = createElement('h7', 'S1');
info_1.position(590,550);

info_2 = createElement('h7', 'S2');
info_2.position(640,550);

info_3 = createElement('h7', 'S3');
info_3.position(690,550);

road_1 = createElement('h7', 'ROAD 1');
road_1.position(120,270);

road_2 = createElement('h7', 'ROAD 2');
road_2.position(320,250);

road_3 = createElement('h7', 'ROAD 3');

** Variables
*** button_start
This variable has been created to create a button, which can be clicked with
the mouse and the function traffic_start can be called.

*** count
This variable is an integer which has been initialized to 0. This variable is
used to iterate over the three different intervals of signals.

*** traffic_interval
This variable sets an interval to iterate with a time delay, so that a specific
set of signals for the three roads stay for a while and then changes to the
next combination.

*** info_1, info_2, info_3
These three variables have been created to display the words S1, S2, S3 on top
of the signals to indicate that each of the signal corresponds to that
particular road.

*** road_1, road_2, road_3
These three variables have been created to display the name of the road next to
the corresponding road diagrams.


** Functions
Two functions viz, traffic_start and traffic_signals have been created to
facilitate the working of this application with ease.
The function traffic_start sets an interval and iterates the loop of function
traffic_signals with a time gap. The function traffic_signals is called within
this function traffic_start.
The function traffic_signals uses the variable count and switches between the
three sub-cases continuously. Each of these sub cases have instructions to fill
out specific colors in the signals thereby indicating the access that has been
given to the vehicles on that specific road.
The red light refers to restriction for vehicles in either one or two
directions, while blue light refers to access to proceed in the rightward
direction and the green light refers to access to proceed in the leftward direction.
