#+TITLE: Documentation for creating a framework that generates all experiments of a lab.
#+AUTHOR: Dheeraj Satyavolu

* Idea


+ In this approach, a library consisting of all the apparatus needed for the
  lab is created and each of the apparatus objects has some predefined functions that it can perform.

+ Now these apparatus objects can be imported from the library and placed on a
  platform where the experiment is to be conducted.

+ All the apparatus objects relevant to a particular experiment of a lab are
  imported and placed in sequential order after assigning each object with a
  task(from the predefined functions for that object).

+ Now, this experiment is launched and an html code is generated. This html code can now be used to launch the experiment online.


* Structure   


+ The page is divided into two frames.

+ One frame will contain all the images of apparatus relevant to our lab.

+ The second frame will contain an empty platform(analogous to the experiment
  table in an actual physical experiment).

+ The apparatus that will be used for this experiment can be dragged from the first frame and dropped into the second frame.


* Working


+ A drag and drop function is employed to be able to drag a specific apparatus
  from the first frame and drop it in the in the second one.

+ Now all the appratus objects are enabled in a manner so as to make it
  possible to right click it and give it a sequence number(the step number
  associated with the apparatus with respect to the experiment) and left click
  it and give it a task(from the predefined tasks it is capable of doing).

+ After doing these steps, an experiment of the lab can be launched. This
  launch command will generate the necessary code for the experiment to be made online with animations.


* Advantages of this approach


+ Using an approach of this sort makes it very easy to populate a lab with
  numerous experiments using the basic apparatus of a lab keeping in mind all
  the things a specific apparatus can do.

+ The requirement to code for each experiment of a lab can be eliminated by
  using this approach.

+ Also building a lab of experiments becomes more organised and structured.


* Table


The below table covers three chemistry labs that are currently available on
virtual labs. This gives an idea of how the predefined functions of the objects
in the proposed library will look like.

NOTE: Below, CASCL stands for Colloid and Surface Chemistry Lab. MASL stands
for Molecular and Absorption Spectroscopy Lab. CDSL stands for Circular
Dichroism Spectroscopy Lab.
