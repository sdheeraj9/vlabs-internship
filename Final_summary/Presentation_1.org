#+TITLE: Project: Exploring frameworks for building virtual labs from scratch
#+AUTHOR: Dheeraj Satyavolu

* Introduction

The advancement in computer science has had a profound impact on almost all
walks of life. The field of education has seen many innovations in this
regard. The traditional and conventional ways of learning have been made
superfluous by innovative and interactive animations that illustrate important
concepts that are taught in high school and college in the form of online
labs. The lack of adequate infrastructure to cater to the needs of the huge population of
Indian students, makes initiatives like Virtual Labs very vital. 



* Motivation  

The idea of simulating real experiments online  that can be performed in labs
at various research institutions is fundamentally important with respect to the
scenario of Indian infrastructure and the ever growing demand for educational
facilities. Hence, the demand for knowing how to create these simulations that
have so many applications for education and training has gone up. Many
institutions in India and abroad are eager to search for better alternatives to
create these simulations, in terms of ease in making, efficiency and visual effects.



* Tools explored

Javascript has introduced a lot of frameworks and libraries for creating simple
and complicated animations. A few of them to list would be:

** P5 library
This is a javascript library that comes handy when one is trying to explore
animations that require artistic tools.

Link: https://p5js.org/

This specific library was explored and a few animations were created. Two of
them are as follows:

*** Traffic Signal Simulator for a Y-junction

+ This is a simple application that uses iteration to manage the traffic at a
  three road intersection and also plots graphs to verify that at no point cars
  coming from different directions run into each other.

+ The github link for this application is:

*** Distance vs time graph plotter

+ The application takes an input of initial distance, initial velocity and
  initial accleration.

+ It plots distance vs time graph for the above mentioned input values.

+ It also lets one pause the graph and change the velocity and accleration
  parameters and alter the path and plot accordingly.

+ The github link for this application is:



** Google Web Designer
+ This framework of javascript was created by Google and is still in beta
  stage. This application's design enables one to create animations in a much more intuitive way without worrying about code.
+ The documentation for using Google Web Designer for the purpose of creating
  virtual labs was made after trying Google Web Designer's beta version.
+ The github link for it is:



* References

+ https://p5js.org/tutorials/ for syntax related help in using P5 framework.

+ http://stackoverflow.com/ for clearing doubts using different methods of
  javascript.


* Conclusion

+ Creating animations for simple concepts of science and technology is an
  important field and has many opportunities.

+ Inspite of attempts by big players of computer science, free and open source
  tools advanced enough to construct animations with ease are scarce and hard
  to find.

+ An attempt was made to try and find interesting tools that can help make
  creating labs easy for Virtual labs initiative.

+ Google web designer was found to be difficult to use due to minor bugs and
  lack of full-fledged tutorials and documentation.

+ p5 framework of javascript is a valuable tool to create artistic animations
  and plotting graphs with relative ease as compared to standard javascript.
